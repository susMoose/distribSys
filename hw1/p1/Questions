Finished: successfully sent registry response, created messagingNodeLists   :)

Next steps: Finish making peer list for odd # of friends then Create a message for each produced peer list (dont forget double connections)
	


Qs:
when registry encounters duplicate attempted node registration, how should it produce an error 
		- duplicate test does not work yet 
		
Does who they get assigned to really have to be random?		
The number of peer
messaging nodes included in messages to different messaging nodes may vary from CR through 1?

// Fix Laters: 
Event.java: ask how to check if request matches origin ip address
MessagingNodesList.java: the searchFor method will definitely  run into concurrency errors
Event.java: fix error throwing case line 54

Handle  case where a messaging node fails just after it sends a registration request
- deal with the case where a messaging node registers and deregisters from the registry before the overlay is set up. 

Fix send tracker


Unknown errors:
- on one startup only 3/4 nodes were listed except receive tracker got 4 messages, receive summation was correct
