Got Done (maybe)
 - TaskQueue adding and removing things from queue
 - creating thread pool
 - threadPool manager
 - sending messages from clients
 - receiving messages for both clients and server
 
 
 
 
 Questions: 
	- 	 Am i clogging task queue too much with accept connection checking for null
	 - is it bad only reading one thing from a channel at a time (true/false attachment)
	- best way to synch stats
	
 Next Steps
  - batch time

Later: 
- check batch time
- add attachment to accepting connections
- maybe make worker thread byte buff a state variable and just clear and rewind more often
- 75a289eec0a33499fbaa6e89081c0efa604fbdd4 repeated weirdness 


Potential future issues: 
	- TaskQueue.java - currentBatchSize compound operation;
	- TaskQueue.java - taskQ.poll line in  waitForTasks()
