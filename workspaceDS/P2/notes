Got Done (maybe)
 - TaskQueue adding and removing things from queue
 - creating thread pool
 - threadPool manager
 - sending messages from clients
 - receiving messages for both clients and server
 
 
 
 
 Questions: 
	
 Next Steps
  - batch time
  - stats
  
  note : wait for batch time seconds 
  -or move synch block up 

Later: 
- remove start script hardcoding of port and location
- check batch time
- maybe make worker thread byte buff a state variable and just clear and rewind more often


Potential future issues: 
	- TaskQueue.java - currentBatchSize compound operation;
	- TaskQueue.java - taskQ.poll line in  waitForTasks()
