Next steps: code message marshallers : 1-9

Qs:
when registry encounters duplicate attempted node registration, it should produce an error and stop or continue? 
How does my thread know who to respond to ?



-----
// Fix Laters: 
Event.java: ask how to check if request matches origin ip address
MessagingNodesList.java: the searchFor method will definitely  run into concurrency errors
Event.java: fix error throwing case line 54

Handle  case where a messaging node fails just after it sends a registration request
